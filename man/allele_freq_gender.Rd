\title{Allele Frequency and Expression Analysis by Gender Across TCGA Cancer Projects}
\usage{
allele_freq_gender(
  allele,
  data,
  project_filter = NULL,
  show_expression = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{allele}{A string specifying the HLA allele to analyze (e.g., "A*02:01", "B*51:07", "C*20:04").}

\item{data}{A data frame containing allele-specific columns, expression data, and TCGA project IDs.}

\item{project_filter}{(Optional) A string specifying a TCGA project ID to filter the analysis (e.g., "TCGA-BRCA").
If NULL, the analysis is conducted across all projects. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{show_expression}{Logical; if TRUE, includes box plots of expression levels in the output. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
  - `results_table`: A data frame with allele frequency and expression statistics stratified by gender.
  - `plot`: A combined visualization showing allele frequency and expression levels.
}
\description{
This function analyzes the frequency and expression levels of a specific HLA allele across TCGA cancer projects,
stratified by gender (Male/Female). It generates a summary table and visualizations to explore allele distributions.
